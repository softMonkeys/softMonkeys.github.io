    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p><img align="right" src="image/uc.png" alt="UofC">I am currently in my fourth year of a BSc. in Computer Science at the <b>University of Calgary</b>. Learning software programming and algorithms has given me the academic foundation to become a better developer. Coding in Java, C and C++ has made me skilled in object-oriented design. I have decided to complete a Software Engineering concentration as part of my undergraduate study, as I especially enjoy developing software on my own and as a team. In past semesters, my teammates and I have designed several projects. Projects included a tribute to Super Mario Bros. on the Raspberry Pi, as well as three Android apps for automating certain functions via smartphone. The capstone project that I am working on is to help the HireGround®️ Software Solution company to improve accuracy of the machine learning algorithm of HR software. This project not only has taught me the importance of project management, but it also reinforced my interest in the areas of software engineering.</p>

    <h2>Interest</h2>
    <p>Instrument is one of the most important thing in my life. I started learning guitar since I was 12, I first guitar is the 20 years old Yamaha classical guitar that my father used. The string and the bridge are so old that it is almost impossible to press and play the notes on flats. However, I still enjoyed playing since I find music makes me relaxed and happy. I continue practicing and joined my first band in Grade 10. We had fun practicing together and performing during the music festival.</p>
