    <h1>CPSC 594</h1>
    <p><img id="engineering" align="right" src="image/engineering.png" alt="UofC">CPSC 594 is a senior undergraduate course offered by the Department of Computer Science at the <b>University of Calgary</b>. It is the capstone course for those students wishing to receive a BSc with a concentration in Software Engineering. The goal of the course is for students to apply their software engineering knowledge in a practical project that is relevant to industry.<br /></p>
    
        <p><img align="right" src="image/hireground.png" alt="UofC">In September of 2018, my colleagues and I began a capstone project supervised under Dr. Günther Ruhe. Our team’s goal was to improve the accuracy of a machine learning algorithm used in an HR application created by HireGround. Using Python and Postgres, we employed a learning method called a <b>support vector machine</b> (or SVM) in order to extract different models for resume sections. During the first semester, our team was challenged by not only technical issues, but also managing the scope of the project. Our team’s goals this semester include reconfiguring the existing deep learning algorithm, and training the models that we created from last semester. This project not only taught me the importance of project management, but it also reinforced my interest in the areas of software engineering.  I think that projects like these within graduate studies will expand my breadth of knowledge, and become better at software development in teams.<br /><br />
